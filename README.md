Step 1: Gather Components:
• Raspberry Pi (with necessary peripherals like keyboard, mouse, and monitor)
• Pi Camera module
• Relay module
• Indication LED lights
• External power source (such as a USB power bank or a wall adapter)
• Switch
• Helmet detection dataset (images/videos of people wearing and not wearing helmets)
Step 2: Set Up Raspberry Pi:
• Install the Raspberry Pi OS (e.g., Raspbian) onto an SD card using a computer.
• Insert the SD card into the Raspberry Pi and connect peripherals (keyboard, mouse,
monitor).
• Boot up the Raspberry Pi and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the setup
process, including connecting to Wi-Fi.
Step 3: Install Dependencies:
• Open a terminal on the Raspberry Pi.
• Install necessary software dependencies such as Python, TensorFlow, OpenCV, and any
other libraries required for YOLO and camera operations.
Step 4: Develop or Obtain YOLO Detection Model:
• Develop a YOLO-based object detection model for detecting helmets.
• Preprocess the dataset and annotate the dataset.
• Train the model using the helmet detection dataset to distinguish between helmetwearing and non-helmet-wearing individuals.
• Validate and fine-tune the model to improve accuracy.
• Save the trained model as “best.pt”
Step 5: Transfer Model to Raspberry Pi:
• Connect the Raspberry Pi to the internet via Wi-Fi or Ethernet.
• Transfer the trained YOLO model file (e.g., weights and .cfg files) to the Raspberry Pi
using SCP (Secure Copy Protocol) or other file transfer methods.
• Place the model files in the appropriate directory on the Raspberry Pi.
Step 6: Write Detection Code:
• Develop Python code to interface with the Pi Camera module and perform real-time
helmet detection using the YOLO model.
• Integrate logic for controlling the relay module based on the detection results (e.g.,
enabling/disabling the bike's ignition).
• Implement code for handling LED indication lights and switch input.
Step 7: Connect Hardware Components:
• Attach the Pi Camera module to the Raspberry Pi's camera port.
• Connect the relay module to the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins for controlling the bike's
ignition system.
• Wire up the indication LED lights to GPIO pins for visual feedback.
• Optionally, connect a switch to GPIO pins for manual control or system activation.
Step 8: Test Hardware and Software Integration:
• Power on the Raspberry Pi and ensure all components are functioning correctly.
• Run the detection code and verify that the Pi Camera captures video feed and the
YOLO model detects helmets accurately.
• Test the relay module to ensure it can control the bike's ignition system based on
detection results.
• Check the indication LED lights for proper functionality.
Step 9: Finalize Installation and Mounting:
• Mount the Raspberry Pi and other components securely on the motorcycle.
• Ensure all connections are stable and insulated against environmental factors
(vibration, moisture, etc.).
Step 10: Field Testing and Calibration:
• Conduct field testing to validate the system's performance under real-world
conditions.
• Fine-tune detection parameters and system behavior as necessary to optimize
performance and reliability.
Step 11: Deployment and Maintenance:
• Deploy the Intelligent Helmet Enhancement System on motorcycles to enhance rider
safety.
• Regularly inspect and maintain the system components to ensure proper functioning
and reliability.
• Monitor system performance and address any issues or updates as needed
